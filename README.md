# Placement Prediction Using Excel Linear Regression 📈🎓

This project uses Microsoft Excel to perform **linear regression** based on previous placement trends to **predict student placement outcomes**. The model is built entirely using Excel formulas and tools like charts, trendlines, and regression functions.

## 📌 Features

- Predict placement chances from historical data
- Uses Excel's built-in regression tools
- Graphical analysis with trendlines
- Dynamic input for student scores and grades
- Simple and clean dashboard layout

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Microsoft Excel (Formulas, Charts, Regression Tool)
- Statistical Analysis
- Data Visualization

## 🛠 How It Works

1. Input previous placement data (marks, grades, placement status)
2. Excel calculates regression coefficients
3. Enter a new student's marks/grades
4. Model predicts likelihood of placement

## 📂 Files Included

- `Placement_Prediction.xlsx` - Main Excel file with model and charts
- `Sample_Data.csv` - Sample dataset for training/testing

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Integrate with Python (pandas + scikit-learn)
- Build web-based input form
- Automate data imports from external sources
